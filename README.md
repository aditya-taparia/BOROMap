### What it does

Our project helps the user to place the things they want to lend others in their locality or you can also borrow from others.

## How we built it

#### Frameworks Used:
* React JS: Hooks, Axios
* A JavaScript library called MapboxGL
* Express JS(A node.js framework)

#### Database Used:
* MongoDB


## Challenges we ran into

* Making use of MapboxGL in react hooks due to limited tutorials
* Making sure the data is always up and running so that it doesn't just go on every refresh
* Stopping the infinite looping of fetching data from a http req when using Axios

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:

* Made a fully functionally MERN Stack Application
* Provided an affordable easy to use solution for the world's waste management problem
* Found and used an alternative for Google Maps (as they have started charging money for using Maps)

## What we learned

* Use of different types of hooks in React
* Handling MapboxGL
* Using Routes
* Handling HTTP requests


## What's next for BORO Maps?

Adding more features like:

* Asking the user to verify the address with an admin user interaction
* Allowing users to add more than one items
* Making an easy-to-use dashboard
* Keeping it affordable and reaching out to the people
* Adding more map functions
