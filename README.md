How we built it
Framework Used:

React JS: Hooks, Axios
A JavaScript library called MapboxGL
Node JS, Express JS.
Database Used:

MongoDB
Challenges we ran into
Making use of MapboxGL in react hooks due to limited tutorials
Making sure the data is always up and running so that it doesn't just go on every refresh
Stopping the infinite looping of fetching data from a http req when using Axios
Accomplishments that we're proud of
Made a fully functionally MERN Stack Application
Provided an affordable easy to use solution for the world's waste management problem
Found and used an alternative for Google Maps (as they have started charging money for using Maps)
What we learned
Use of different types of hooks in React
Handling MapboxGL
Using Routes
Handling HTTP requests
What's next for BORO Maps
Adding more features like:

Asking the user to verify the address with an admin user interaction
Allowing users to add more than one items
Making an easy-to-use dashboard
Keeping it affordable and reaching out to the people
Adding more map functions
