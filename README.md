### How to run:

We have to run 2 commands simultaneouslsy suing terminal from the project folder, they are:
1. npm start 
2. nodemon server/index.js

### What it does

Our project helps the user to place the things they want to lend others in their locality or you can also borrow from others.

## How we built it

Frameworks Used:

React JS: Hooks, Axios
A JavaScript library called MapboxGL
Node JS, Express JS.


### Database Used:

MongoDB


### Challenges we ran into


1.Making use of MapboxGL in react hooks due to limited tutorials
2.Making sure the data is always up and running so that it doesn't just go on every refresh
3.Stopping the infinite looping of fetching data from a http req when using Axios


### Accomplishments that we're proud of:

1.Made a fully functionally MERN Stack Application
2.Provided an affordable easy to use solution for the world's waste management problem
3.Found and used an alternative for Google Maps (as they have started charging money for using Maps)


### What we learned

1.Use of different types of hooks in React
2.Handling MapboxGL
3.Using Routes
4.Handling HTTP requests


### What's next for BORO Maps?

Adding more features like:

1.Asking the user to verify the address with an admin user interaction
2.Allowing users to add more than one items
3.Making an easy-to-use dashboard
4.Keeping it affordable and reaching out to the people
5.Adding more map functions
